### Useful resources

- [Firseship](https://youtu.be/Qhaz36TZG5Y?t=422) - This channel is one of my favorites for dipping my toes into new technologies.It's very straight foward and I always learn something new. This particular video hada neat CSS trick that I ended up using.

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - While I could list out every article that I used from MDN, I would rather keep this concise. This is definitely my favorite resource to learn about everything HTML, CSS, and JS.

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/defaulT.asp) - This resource is great if I want to quickly learn what a keyword does. It is much simpler and is my prefered website when quickly looking something up.
